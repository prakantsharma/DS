# Data Structures & Algorithms 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository.  
This repository contains well-structured and optimized solutions to common DSA
problems, implemented mainly in **Java**, with clear explanations and clean code.

The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving skills and maintain
revision-friendly notes for interviews and exams.
