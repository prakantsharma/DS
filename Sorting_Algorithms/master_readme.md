# 📚 Sorting Algorithms – DSA Master README

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms** section of my Data Structures & Algorithms repository.  
This section focuses on **basic and foundational sorting techniques** that build strong problem-solving skills.

## 📌 What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).  
Efficient sorting improves searching, data organization, and overall performance in applications.

# 🔢 Sorting Algorithms Covered

## 1️⃣ Bubble Sort
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets

📄 File: `bubble_sort.md`

**Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Space: O(1)
- Stable: ✅ Yes

---

## 2️⃣ Selection Sort
- Selects the minimum element and places it at the correct position
- Performs minimum swaps

📄 File: `selection_sort.md`

**Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n²)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Space: O(1)
- Stable: ❌ No

---

## 3️⃣ Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time
- Efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays

📄 File: `insertion_sort.md`

**Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Space: O(1)
- Stable: ✅ Yes

---

## 4️⃣ Merge Sort
- Divide and conquer algorithm
- Recursively divides the array and merges sorted halves
- Efficient for large datasets

📄 File: `merge_sort.md`

**Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Space: O(n)
- Stable: ✅ Yes

---

## 5️⃣ Quick Sort
- Uses pivot element to partition the array
- Very fast in practice

📄 File: `quick_sort.md`

**Complexity**
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Space: O(log n)
- Stable: ❌ No
